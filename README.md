**Pocket** is the best way to save articles, videos and more. When you find something on the web that you want to view later, 
put it in Pocket. It automatically syncs to your phone, tablet or computer so you can view it at any time, even without an internet connection.

Bolso is a Pocket client for the GNOME Desktop which allows you to browse your Pocket lists and visualize your saved-for-later items inside the app.

This app was not developed by the Pocket creators at *Read It Later, Inc*.
